    <h3 class="f">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <p><h4>Step</h4></p> <p>Position the oven racks in the center and lower third of the oven. Fill a roasting pan halfway with water and place on the lower rack. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.</p></li>
        <li> <p><h4>Step</h4></p> <p>Make cheesecake: Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy; reduce speed to medium-low. Add white sugar and beat for 2 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in sour cream and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour and set cheesecake batter aside.</p></li>
        <li> <p><h4>Step</h4></p> <p>Make carrot cake: Beat together brown sugar and oil in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add egg and beat for 2 minutes; reduce speed to low. Mix in flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt until combined. Fold carrots and walnuts into batter.</p></li>
        <li> <p><h4>Step</h4></p> <p>Spread carrot cake batter into the prepared pan; top with cheesecake batter. Place the pan on the center rack above the roasting pan with water.</p></li>
        <li> <p><h4>Step</h4></p> <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is set, about 1 hour and 10 minutes, covering the top with aluminum foil if browning too quickly. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li> <p><h4>Step</h4></p> <p>Run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen cake; cool to room temperature in the pan on a wire rack. Place in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours to overnight.</p></li>
        <li> <p><h4>Step</h4></p> <p></p>Make frosting: Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, and almond extract in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until smooth.</li>
        <li> <p><h4>Step</h4></p> <p></p>Remove the ring of the pan. Spread frosting on top of chilled cheesecake layer.</li>
    </ol>
